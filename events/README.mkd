# Overview

This service handles collecting, munging, and routing event data. It collects very loosely structured JSON blobs and pushes them into their respective environment's Kinesis stream. The primary handler loads up the record, parses the payload, and runs the corresponding event type's processor found in `types/`. If there is an error, or the event type is invalid, it will be pushed into an errors queue for debugging.
